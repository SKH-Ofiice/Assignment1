    <h1> <a href="">When a good deed can buy a meal</a> </h1>

    <p>Ten-year-old boy Suman ran away from his home in Narayanganj after his mother’s death. His father had remarried and the new wife used to beat Suman. Suman landed up in Kamalapur Railway Station in the capital. The platforms became his home. He was an incurious boy, sitting alone quietly in a corner. Other street children on the platform said he wouldn’t talk to anybody or eat properly. He had sores all over his body as he couldn’t bathe every day. Other children used to avoid him.

        Some members of a voluntary organisation one day came to his rescue. He was taken to hospital and fed well. The name of the organisation is ‘Bhalo Kajer Hotel’. It provides meal to people in exchange of at least one good deed a day. The mastermind of the organisation, Arifur Rahman, told the tale with a broad smile. </p>
